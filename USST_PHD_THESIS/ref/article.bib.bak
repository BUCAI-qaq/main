  abstract = {A universal, approximation-free state feedback control scheme is designed for unknown pure feedback systems, capable of guaranteeing, for any initial system condition, output tracking with prescribed performance and bounded closed loop signals. By prescribed performance, it is meant that the output error converges to a predefined arbitrarily small residual set, with convergence rate no less than a certain prespecified value, having maximum overshoot less than a preassigned level. The proposed state feedback controller isolates the aforementioned output performance characteristics from control gains selection and exhibits strong robustness against model uncertainties, while completely avoiding the explosion of complexity issue raised by backstepping-like approaches that are typically employed to the control of pure feedback systems. In this respect, a low complexity design is achieved. Moreover, the controllability assumptions reported in the relevant literature are further relaxed, thus enlarging the class of pure feedback systems that can be considered. Finally, simulation studies clarify and verify the approach.},

Based on the Nussbaum-gain technique and Barrier Lyapunov functions, the position-constrained consensus protocol is proposed for the multi-agent systems with unknown control directions. The proposed protocol ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are globally bounded and the consensus errors asymptotically converge to zero. Moreover, during the process of consensus, the trajectory of the position state of each agent is contained in the open interval which can be chosen arbitrarily in advance. A simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocol.},

  abstract = {In this study, an adaptive control technique is developed for a class of uncertain nonlinear parametric systems. The considered systems can be viewed as a class of nonlinear pure-feedback systems and the full state constraints are strictly required in the systems. One remarkable advantage is that only less adjustable parameters are used in the design. This advantage is first to take into account the pure-feedback systems with the full state constraints. The characteristics of the considered systems will lead to a difficult task for designing a stable controller. To this end, the mean value theorem is employed to transform the pure-feedback systems to a strict-feedback structure but non-affine terms still exist. For the transformed systems, a novel recursive design procedure is constructed to remove the difficulties for avoiding non-affine terms and guarantee that the full state constraints are not violated by introducing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) with the error variables. Moreover, it is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are global uniformly bounded and the tracking error is remained in a bounded compact set. Two simulation studies are worked out to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, an adaptive controller design is studied for single-input–single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems with parameter uncertainties and the systems are enforced to subject to the full state constraints. A remarkable feature of the constrained systems is that the so-called control direction is unknown, or in other words, the signs of control gains are unknown. In the existing results, we discover that all the state constraint control results are required to determine a priori knowledge of control direction. It will be inevitable to bring about a different design procedure and a difficult task when no a priori knowledge of control direction is known. To stabilize this class of systems, two parameter adaptive controllers with Nussbaum gain technique are constructively framed to overcome the unknown control direction problem, and the novel symmetric and asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs) are adopted to guarantee that the states are not to violate their constraints. Then, the proposed \{BLF\} strategy can be to conquer the conservatism of the traditional BLF-based controls for the full state constraints. Finally, two theorems are provided to show that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded, the outputs are driven to follow the reference signals and all the states are ensured to remain in the predefined compact sets. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is performed via a simulation example. },

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate output synchronization problem of nonlinear systems that can be transformed into strict feedback form with unknown control direction. To this end, an augmented Laplacian potential function is introduced to construct local level distributed adaptive controllers such that outputs of networked agents can be synchronized while all other states maintain bounded. Moreover, tuning functions are designed to reduce the order of the parameter updater. In contrast to conventional adaptive backstepping procedure, both the parameter updating law and tuning function of the proposed scheme take advantage of information flow among networked agents and thus distributive in nature. It is proved that output synchronization of the entire network can be achieved by properly choosing Nussbaum functions, provided the information graph is undirected and connected. Furthermore, we also proposed a way to define a proper Nussbaum function. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

Asymptotic tracking is achieved without violation of the constraint, and all closed loop signals remain bounded, under a mild condition on the initial output. Furthermore, we explore the use of an Asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function as a generalized approach that relaxes the requirements on the initial conditions. We also compare our control with one that is based on a Quadratic Lyapunov Function, and we show that our control requires less restrictive initial conditions.

We show that asymptotic output tracking is achieved without violation of the output constraint, and also quantify the transient performance bound as a function of time that converges to zero. To handle parametric model uncertainty, we present an adaptive controller that ensures constraint satisfaction during the transient phase of online parameter adaptation.

To prevent the states from violating the constraints, we employ a barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), which grows to infinity whenever its arguments approaches some finite limits. Based on BLF-based backstepping, we show that asymptotic output tracking is achieved without violation of any constraint, provided that the initial states and control parameters are feasible. We also establish sufficient conditions to ensure feasibility, which can be checked offline without precise knowledge of the initial states. The feasibility conditions are relaxed when handling the partial state constraint problem as compared to the full state constraint problem. In the presence of parametric uncertainties, BLF-based adaptive backstepping is useful in preventing the states from transgressing the constrained region during the transient stages of online parameter adaptation. To relax the feasibility conditions, asymmetric error bounds are considered and asymmetric barrier functions are used for control design. The performance of the BLF-based control is illustrated with two simulated examples. },

Both leaderless and leader-following consensus protocols are proposed for multi-agents with unknown control directions based on the Nussbaum-type gains. For the leaderless case, the proposed protocol can guarantee that the consensus errors asymptotically converge to zero. Moreover, for the leader-following case, the Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the consensus tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the control parameters. It should also be noted that these proposed protocols do not require any information about the global communication topology and work with only the relative information of neighboring agents. Illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols. },

  abstract = {Different from traditional centralized control, one major challenge of distributed consensus tracking control lies in the constraint that the desired reference trajectory is only accessible by part of the subsystems. Currently, most existing schemes require the availability of partial knowledge of the reference trajectories to all of the subsystems or information exchange of local control inputs. In this paper, we investigate distributed adaptive consensus tracking control without such requirements for nonlinear high-order multi-agent systems subjected to mismatched unknown parameters and uncertain external disturbances. By introducing compensating terms in a smooth function form of consensus errors and certain positive integrable functions in each step of virtual control design, a new backstepping based distributed adaptive control protocol is proposed. An extra estimator is designed in each subsystem to handle the parametric uncertainties involved in its neighbors’ dynamics, which avoids information exchange of local neighborhood consensus errors among connected subsystems. It is shown that global uniform boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and asymptotically output consensus tracking can be achieved. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our scheme.},

Unlike the existing consensus algorithms for second-order multi-agent systems in which all agents are assumed to have common unit inertias or share common control gains, we allow the inertias and the control gains to be heterogeneous and time-varying for each agent. We propose fully distributed consensus algorithms over a general directed graph when there exist, respectively, absolute velocity damping and relative velocity damping. Novel integral-type Lyapunov functions are proposed to study the consensus convergence. Moreover, the adaptive σ-modification schemes for the gain adaptation are proposed, which renders smaller control gains and thus requires smaller amplitude on the control input without sacrificing consensus convergence. Furthermore, we show that one proposed algorithm also works for consensus of agents with intrinsic Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics.

A Nussbaum-type adaptive controller is designed for each agent such that consensus of the network can be achieved while all signals in the overall system maintain bounded. The distributed controller for each agent has two parts: neighborhood error between itself and the neighbors and a Nussbaum-type item for seeking control direction adaptively. The argument of the Nussbaum-type function is tuned on line via an appropriately designed update law. It is proved that when the undirected graph is connected or the balanced digraph is weakly connected, consensus of the network can be realized. Furthermore, a distributed asymptotic regulator is proposed to regulate the overall system to the equilibrium. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.},

Recent advances are surveyed according to the method of occurrence of the stochasticity of the MASs. First, the consensus problem is discussed for MASs, wherein individual agents are corrupted by random noises, i.e., the dynamics of agents involve stochasticity in process and/or measurement equations. Both additive noises and multiplicative noises are surveyed in detail and special attention is paid to the MASs whose dynamics are governed by It{\^o} differential equations. Moreover, particular effort is devoted to presenting the latest progress on the consensus problem for a special type of stochastic MAS with Markovian jump parameters. Subsequently, the relevant research is summarized for MASs with noisy communication environments and stochastic sampling. Further, we provide a systematic review of the consensus problems for MASs whose communication topology varies randomly in the process of data propagation among agents. Finally, conclusions are drawn and several potential future research directions are outlined.},

The aim of this paper is to design a locally optimal time-varying estimator to simultaneously estimate both the system states and the fault signals such that, at each sampling instant, the covariance of the estimation error has an upper bound that is minimized by properly designing the estimator gain. The explicit form of the estimator gain is characterized in terms of the solutions to two difference equations. It is shown that the developed estimation algorithm is of a recursive form that is suitable for online computations. In addition, the performance analysis of the proposed estimation algorithm is conducted and a sufficient condition is given to verify the exponential boundedness of the estimation error in the mean square sense. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to show the usefulness of the developed estimation scheme.},

The measurements from different sensors may undergo the missing phenomena, which are characterized by a set of mutually independent Bernoulli random variables and the missing probabilities could be uncertain. In addition, the event-triggered transmission mechanism is introduced to reduce the network communication burden, where the current measurement is transmitted to the remote filter only when it changes greatly compared with the previous one. The aim of this paper is to design a time-varying filter such that, in the presence of the multiple missing measurements, event-triggered transmission mechanism and stochastic nonlinearities, an upper bound of the filtering error covariance is obtained and then minimized by properly designing the filter gain. The explicit form of the filter gain is given in terms of the solutions to two recursive matrix equations. It is shown that the developed filtering scheme is of a recursive form applicable for the online computations.

This quantizer is a combination of a logarithmic (or a hysteresis) quantizer and a uniform quantizer, and it has the advantages of both logarithmic and uniform quantizers in ensuring reducible communication expenses and acceptable quantization errors for better system performances. Compared with existing results in adaptive control, the proposed scheme provides a way to relax certain restrictive conditions, in addition to solving the problem of adaptive output-feedback control with input quantization. It is shown that the designed adaptive controller ensures global boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system and enables the tracking error to exponentially converge towards a compact set which is adjustable.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to carry resources in support of search and prosecute operations. Often to completely prosecute a target, UAVs may have to simultaneously attack the target with various resources with different capacities. However, the UAVs are capable of carrying only limited resources in small quantities, hence, a group of UAVs (coalition) needs to be assigned that satisfies the target resource requirement. The assigned coalition must be such that it minimizes the target prosecution delay and the size of the coalition. The problem of forming coalitions is computationally intensive due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, but for real-time applications computationally cheap solutions are required. In this paper, we propose decentralized sub-optimal (polynomial time) and decentralized optimal coalition formation algorithms that generate coalitions for a single target with low computational complexity. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithms to that of a global optimal solution for which we need to solve a centralized combinatorial optimization problem. This problem is computationally intensive because the solution has to (a) provide a coalition for each target, (b) design a sequence in which targets need to be prosecuted, and (c) take into account reduction of UAV resources with usage. To solve this problem we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Through simulations, we study the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of mission performance, complexity of the algorithms and the time taken to form the coalition. The simulation results show that the solution provided by the proposed algorithms is close to the global optimal solution and requires far less computational resources.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent coordination and control under multiple objectives, and presents a set-theoretic formulation amenable to Lyapunov-based analysis and control design. A novel class of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is introduced and used to encode multiple, non-trivial control objectives, such as collision avoidance, proximity maintenance and convergence to desired destinations. The construction is based on recentered barrier functions and on maximum approximation functions. Thus, a single Lyapunov-like function is used to encode the constrained set of each agent, yielding simple, gradient-based control solutions. The derived control strategies are distributed, i.e., based on information locally available to each agent, which is dictated by sensing and communication limitations. Furthermore, the proposed coordination protocol dictates semi-cooperative conflict resolution among agents, which can be also thought as prioritization, as well as conflict resolution with respect to an agent (the leader) which is not actively participating in collision avoidance, except when necessary. The considered scenario is pertinent to surveillance tasks and involves nonholonomic vehicles. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through simulation results.},
